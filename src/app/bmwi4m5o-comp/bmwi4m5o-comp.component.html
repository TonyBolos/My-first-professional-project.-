    <h4>The i4 M50</h4>
    <p>The dynamic driving capabilities and design features of the BMW i4 M50.
        Electrifying the senses: the BMW i4 M50 develops a powerful output of 544 hp with the help of two BMW M eDrive electric motors operating in Sport Boost mode and it offers a completely new driving experience with the help of technologies specific to the M models. All these allow it to accelerate sharply from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.9 seconds and move in a dynamic way rich in adrenaline with a level of precision that characterizes BMW M models, accompanied by particularly stimulating driving sounds from BMW M IconicSounds Electric. The M aerodynamic package (standard) and the M Technology package (option) upgrade the experience. The unique Cerium Gray design elements and the impressive systems that characterize the M models, from the closed M kidney grille to the M rear spoiler, complete the dynamic and advanced appearance. in,BMW's new convex display facing the driver and a slim dashboard create a super-modern atmosphere. Additional elements from the M worlds such as the M sports seats for the driver and front passenger or the M leather-wrapped steering wheel with contrasting stitching lend a sporty touch.</p>
